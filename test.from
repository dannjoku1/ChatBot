I have the exact same model and I feel the same way about it! Although the Allen key is a PITA to find when I need to take it down...
Would be nice if you could compile it all into one post, as it's kind of covering the entire subreddit front page.
On the right a Springfield loaded in black stainless and on the left a Charles daly.... No comparison. At all. Like not even close. It's sad. Charles daly was super cheap and I won't cringe when it gets a scratch. 
MS PAINT ADVENTUUURESSSSS
Mag well looks different...curious what OP says about that.
OP delivers
Springfield. Kimber insists on using a firing pin block.
I'm married to a redhead, and I'm ok with soulless. However I dare not call that beautiful woman an abomination.

This town is 500000x better when you have a boat. Seriously. So many bars have docks, then there's the islands. I guess it's really just 'hey lets go drink in this different spot now' but it still fun.
you have ireland in your username... I'm sorry but it would be unfair of us to allow your opinion on redheads to count :D
Suppose one had a boat. Can you elaborate on the boating culture. I'm near the port so i know of the bars on the water there though I have never been by boat.
That's awesome! When QuietFlight86 gets his boat we can totally have boat parties.
Like... FTB jetpacks?
Did you read that, QuietFlight86?  Get cracking on that boat!
Yep, that's me, she's still driving it too, running biodiesel and WVO. I miss that car some days :/
Hahaha. 5 downvotes and a lost subscriber. I think people are mad.
Oh god... 
Ich auch. Wassermelone ist nicht gut. Ich bevorzuge Erdbeeren.
If I were to make a network structure for this game, I would create a system of nodes that relay messages until it reaches a target. It would be an anarchistic version of the WWW, with no centralized ISP or DNS servers, just local DNS databases at each node. 
No, they're literally smell like maple syrup. They're 'scratch-n-sniff'
I just hope it doesn't turn out that we have to elevate Notch to the same pedestal as Gabe Newell, Gaben holding HL 3 and Notch, 0x10^c
Great looking guns. I love the Kimbers.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, there is no apostrophe in '1911s.'
I use a Old Faithful Stealth Tuck hip holster.  I currently have the stock G10 grips on my Sig Scorpion, but they are super aggressive and rough (great for posi-control when shooting, but a pain in the side when carrying)
Nice. What're your thoughts on those plastic buffers they sell that fit around the barrel if I remember correctly? 
Take a serious look at the STI Trojan, it's fantastic.
You're in for a surprise

I have been shopping for a non pro model. The 5 inch barrel instead of the 4. I really like it though. Took it out for some rounds tonight. I'm looking for a green laser and nice holster haha. 
I have done both. I like my Blackhawk SERPA holster for open carry, I prefer an IWB holster for concealed. I use a Galco King Tuck for that, but I'm waiting for my Raven Concealment holster so I can keep my light on my gun.
I usually just laugh at these, but I *really* need me some context. Please OP.
I'll have to take a look into those. I'm leaning more towards a concealed carry just so I don't put people on edge. I just want to use the gun at the range and as self defense if I ever need it. 
Ok cool. I'll double check and make sure but so far no issues. The Hobbes cleaner worked really well too. I made sure to clean the gun before use and it took all the gunk the gun was sent with off. 
the boy is falling from a swing
It's not unrelated at all since 0x10c has confirmed rift support. This is great news!
I believe if you go back, set the difficulty on hard, and open the safe you can get the ending. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyone tried it?
Thank you, sir, but how could you know? You've never even seen my mom.

1. Learn to swim.
Yeah, that too. I'm hoping we'll see ancient space civilization ruins to muck around in for that stuff. :D
You are correct, just had that in computer architecture.
To be fair, registers can be in the RAM (just not in the DCPU). newlinechar  newlinechar For example, PIC microchips use various addresses in its RAM to keep registers.
thats a long swim mate...
[](/rarityannoyed) Ug, I really watch just the watch. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah well I'll just sell the game when it gets in...
Someone mentioned that people meet Thursday's in Melbourne. I'll probably look into it.
Silver was good, but I couldn't quite get into it for some reason. I'll have to listen to it a few more times before I can really start digging it.
Sounds safe 
I do believe that programming would never be required. If anything, they'll include prebuilt control programs for the ship that way you don't have to manually write them, but regardless, the DCPU DOES control the engines, which has been stated before by Notch if I recall correctly.
Iunno, notch's posts seemed pretty clear that we could fly the ship by hand, without using DCPU. Everything will be able to connect to one, but it won't be required. 
Yeah yeah, highly improbable and if occurring terribly chaotic, but awesome as HELL if done well. newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't a man allowed to dream?
I was banned for posting a motivational poster, which apparently is considered a meme. No warning or anything. Assholes.
With 311 there's always something you can rock with. A good friend of mine's favorite song is Sever, I still have no idea why. 
Why are his wings pierced?!
They are not pierced. They have a small plastic band going around the skinnier part of the wing. It's essentially an ID bracelet, as it's close to impossible to tell one penguin apart from another.

Do you mind telling me the store? I'm up I-75 from you, and while I have no interest in purchasing it, I'd love to see the 'Commander' model.
If you get a boat let me know, I'm in Cape Canaveral too
Ja, ich auch. Aber ich mag Wassermelon nicht. (Es tut mir Led. Dieser Computer ist nicht ein Deutsch-Computer).
As a Canadian I had to think 'benjamins' twice. Here it is usually 'a brown', or 'a bob/robert'... But it is seldom used. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess now we could say 'maples' since our new polymer $100 bills are maple perfumed.
When you say 'perfumed' do you mean something other than 'smells like a maple tree'?
that is a wonderful game. playing through it atm. much more difficult than portal, but it's very fun and pretty
I think that it's actually 2PM.
I have a theory that the reason Notch hasnt been apparently doing much 0x10c development is because he hasnt had a Rift devkit, and he wants to make it an integral part of the game?
For that amount of money you could have got one decent one. You know, with the front strap cut properly. I mean, if they can't get something obvious like that right, you gotta' wonder what else they missed.
This also explains the lazer guns, and the 3D holographic projectors...
Sorry, that's 3.
I think you mean planking... 
very nice. I really dig the 2 tone look. how does it shoot?

I'm sorry, we already have a Bender. You can be Leela?
Minecraft already has support for red/cyan 3D, which is a very odd and Notchy thing to implement. Has been there forever. So I have no doubt that Jeb will put it in. Notch on the other hand does not work on Minecraft anymore, so he won't.
&gt;Alternate Universe newlinechar  newlinechar Also, he hasn't stated that it was released in the late 80's, just that it was popular. That could have been because of ease of use, or price, or compatibility with existing components.
