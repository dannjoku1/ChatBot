Mine kept coming loose after a hundred rounds or so, I replaced it with a Wilson combat single piece full length guide rod. I love it.
I would, but i can't. since the limit is 10000 and some are 2000 on their own.
Nice. I have the same exact Springfield.

you have ireland in your username... I'm sorry but it would be unfair of us to allow your opinion on redheads to count :D
Thanks. Been to TargetWorld a number of times, in fact; I'll have to go by later this week.
Suppose one had a boat. Can you elaborate on the boating culture. I'm near the port so i know of the bars on the water there though I have never been by boat.
Lol it's my last name, but it's actually a Scottish last name.
If you get a boat let me know, I'm in Cape Canaveral too
Did you read that, QuietFlight86?  Get cracking on that boat!
I've not seen jetpacks mentioned, but a first person space game without them sounds unlikely.
Boat drinks.
I know it.  Fixed up the interior something nice.
Maybe just a liiiiittle salty!

Perhaps each node would be responsible for handing out domains on their own TLD as well as passing traffic onto other nodes. Each node would be  a planet or city or whatever.
So... muggers can literally smell the money on you now?
Sweet, glad to hear HL3 was confirmed.
I'll keep that one in mind. There's only one Kimber, probably least expensive other than the RIA, but its a great shooter. newlinechar 
I looked up your gun, you have the golf ball textured grips? I would try the VZ Frags or the Tactical Diamonds. I like G10/Micarta personally. The holster looks good, I used a similar one made by Galco for a long time. 
The Shock Buff fits on the guide rod, not really necessary.  Read all the articles on the 10-8 website, they are very informative. You'll find answers to any question you should have about the 1911. I can't recommend reading this enough. newlinechar http://www.10-8performance.com/pages/1911-User%27s-Guide.html
Any idea if they are MA compliant?
Did you major in video games?
I majored in Commander Keen
when i read the title of this thread before reading the comments, i said to my self the exact same thing. This and omaha stylee from live. I also like visit from the live in omaha from like 92 of 93. newlinechar  newlinechar 
Holy shit, not what I was expecting.  It is a very nice gun.
I have the exact model you're looking for haha. I would just get Crimson trace grips, no need to clutter the rail up. What kind of holster are you looking for?
I'll have to take a look into those. I'm leaning more towards a concealed carry just so I don't put people on edge. I just want to use the gun at the range and as self defense if I ever need it. 
I wish I knew but in a way, it's better not to know.
I understand completely. If you don't want to carry the gun with the light, go for the King Tuck. If you want a light on the gun go Raven, it'll take a couple months though. 
btw beautiful gun, shot one on saturday!
 Thank you! I watched it several times thinking it was a gif in reverse, but even then it wasn't making sense. I started thinking, maybe it was a bounce house incident and he got kicked out &gt; 'rules are rules' and bounced on a platform on the way out?
Glad ya thinks so. heh newlinechar  newlinechar The r/minecraft mods didn't seem to think it was worth posting there. I guess they're not convinced Jeb/Notch will add it to MC. But I'm pretty sure they will. lol
That's what I did.   It works, and you will get the true ending.

Headsets look pretty good. Well made.
 Ah, I've been trying for life. Small hands, small feet, big butt, and now big boobs. I can float like a corpse though. Only at night in a lake of course, so long as there are no gators.
maybe salvage technology found on spaceships of long dead civilization of your descendants...
I've watched many tutorials on how to build computers with redstone, and built a couple, and all called registers to the inputs of the ALU, so I guessed they were the same xD
I think that one is what threw me off.
That's only two laps in an Olympic sized pool. If you can't do that, you shouldn't be lobster diving.
[](/cadence) I'm taking my chances and waiting on a friend to let me know if he'd buy the extra first. Hope I still get one. I'm really surprised it's only in a bundle this late in the game.
Ah yes!  A friend told me they have game nights at this place called 'Famous Faces &amp; Funnies' although I believe it's mostly board/card games rather than videogames though.
With 311 there's always something you can rock with. A good friend of mine's favorite song is Sever, I still have no idea why. 
eh it's not terribly dangerous but it serves no purpose. kinda fun with 22s since you can cheaply pretend you have a bullet hose
Iunno, notch's posts seemed pretty clear that we could fly the ship by hand, without using DCPU. Everything will be able to connect to one, but it won't be required. 
And you might need to, if you take just the right (wrong) kind of battle damage. newlinechar  newlinechar Running this ship without a central control point sounds hilariously hard, though.
Of course! Please dream! newlinechar  newlinechar It'll be especially awesome if you try a manual dogfight against someone using a DCPU to run the fight. \^_^
Dont worry man. They insta banned me when I accidentally posted a FB link... nice gun. 
Dude, sever is one of the best tracks off Soundsystem!
They are not pierced. They have a small plastic band going around the skinnier part of the wing. It's essentially an ID bracelet, as it's close to impossible to tell one penguin apart from another.
That's a relief.  Thanks.

Oh, sorry 'bout that. newlinechar  newlinechar Wait, I'm here again. Dammit. newlinechar  newlinechar We should stop talking.
Alright, thank you. A little out of my price range at the moment. I'm planning on saving up and trying to wait out this panic buyout that's going on. Perhaps by that time, I can afford a Dan Wesson or something similar.
Yep, I see it. I'll increase the default speed and make it configurable.

When you say 'perfumed' do you mean something other than 'smells like a maple tree'?
No, they're literally smell like maple syrup. They're 'scratch-n-sniff'
I wished it was more difficult. I got the actual end in two sittings, about a total of 6 hours. I didn't find any puzzle particually hard. There are a few I must not have done yet though, because I have about 5 or 6 chalkboard things to find yet.
Right, it goes the other way... Carry on.
May be a stupid question, but where will you bwe able to buy the oculus rift once it's released properly (and not just a devkit)? The website? :) newlinechar  newlinechar PS: i blame beer for my stupidiyt, and any spelling errors too..
I'm new to 1911 (still don't own one yet), I'm guessing the front strap is the area in front of the mag well, where your hand/fingers grips the pistol? How can you tell it's not cut properly? 
Yeah, that too. I'm hoping we'll see ancient space civilization ruins to muck around in for that stuff. :D
In Russian - two.
ok second gayest shit on earth
Not sure yet.  Picked it up on my way home from work today.  Going to try and get out in the week or two to go shoot it along with some of the other guns that have been sitting for awhile.
and i give it to him *every* single time.
Yes
I really didn't think they would be such a hit. I made them last night just in case I needed to fix some of them. But they all turned out pretty good. Thanks for the awesome feedback | So hard! newlinechar 
Oh wow, I did actually use an O, my apologies for the snarky comment. I have no idea why I did that. But yeah, I'm fully understanding of hex. 
OP delivers
You're in for a surprise
then just stay inside and plan video games or have lan parties, or go play table top. newlinechar  newlinechar which works nearly the same regardless of were you are.
I do believe that programming would never be required. If anything, they'll include prebuilt control programs for the ship that way you don't have to manually write them, but regardless, the DCPU DOES control the engines, which has been stated before by Notch if I recall correctly.
Makes you feel special and desired
I'm down.
Oh, no, I know most people do. I just don't believe I will. 
COMING TO YOU LOUD AND PROUD FROM THE CAPITAL SPACELANDS
Minecraft already has support for red/cyan 3D, which is a very odd and Notchy thing to implement. Has been there forever. So I have no doubt that Jeb will put it in. Notch on the other hand does not work on Minecraft anymore, so he won't.
HAH, that's also a good reason.
I sincerely hope not. 999 isn't something I would want a nine year old to play.
I don't believe in magic &gt;:( JK
No no, I swear I'm poor, I'm just a messy eater
I care more about unimportant submissions being artifically pushed higher up the subreddit than they deserve to be when judged on the merit of their content.
Yep. That always makes me laugh.
I think you mean planking... 
This town is 500000x better when you have a boat. Seriously. So many bars have docks, then there's the islands. I guess it's really just 'hey lets go drink in this different spot now' but it still fun.
Not a stupid question, just nobody knows yet! Pretty safe to bet they will continue to be available from the website.
I have to admit I was drawn to the backpack thing.
theres no money in it man :P

To be fair, registers can be in the RAM (just not in the DCPU). newlinechar  newlinechar For example, PIC microchips use various addresses in its RAM to keep registers.
